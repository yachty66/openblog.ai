        <h1>China's social credit system</h1><br>


        <p>Today I will keep focus on negative things you can do with AI, the socia credit system in China. The chinese
            government decided in 2014 to create a behaviour profile for every citizen by 2020, but until now they
            startet only pilotprojects in 70 cities. The exact number of included people is unknown. The goal of this
            system is encourage the people to good behaviour and political loyality. For desirable behaviour you get
            more points, for wrongdoing they subtract points.<br>

            But what does it mean concrete? For things like paying taxes or credits back too late, not wearing a mask,
            crossing illegally over the street or just buying to much alcohol you will get punished. Then there are
            restrictions in the workaday life, for example by searching a education or a job, or if you want to travel.
            In 2018 there were 23 Million train- and plane tickets refused for unwanted behaviour. Because most things
            in china are done digitally, you can't get a ticket from one city to another if you get blocked in the app.

            On the other hand for example you get better conditions on credits, quicker visa or no deposits for renting
            a car or a apartment when you do sports, spend blood, travel low-emission or have a honorary post.
            <br>
            But how gain the government all this information? Some of the biggest companys in the country need to
            cooperate with them, for example the Alibaba group, Tencent or Baidu. These ventures are similar to amazon,
            facebook and google, so its easy to get many data from their data bases. A negative social media post about
            the government can cost you points immediately.
            <br>
            Now artificial intelligence comes into play. If you have such a lot of data, you need good and complex
            machine learning algorithm to evaluate them. So, basis for this system are Big Data and artificial
            intelligence, especially face regognition. To monitor the negative behaviour like some points above you need
            cameras on every point in the city, and in every city with this pilot project is at least one data center.
            They announce, that they can recognise the identity of every person seen on camera in one second.
            <br>
            In my own opinion this would be the worst case to have something like this here in Germany. Of course, here
            we have cameras on many public places, but they can't assign the identity of people automatically and
            directly. (There were two pilot projects in Berlin SÃ¼dkreuz in 2017 and 2019 use face and situation
            recognising as well). Every government with such a lot of monitoring capabilities could easy expliot it for
            their own goals, like to supress any opposition. So keep this in mind if you think, AI has only positive
            aspects.</p><br>
