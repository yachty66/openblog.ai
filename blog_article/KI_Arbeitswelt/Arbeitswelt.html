<h1>Opportunities for AI in the world of work</h1><br><br>
<h2>What are the general adcantages of AI in the world of work?</h2>
<p>When it comes to the topic of "artificial intelligence in everyday working life", the first question is what advantages this would bring at all. For example, the working hours of intelligent robots are not limited to 8 hours per day, they do not get sick, and they do not have vacations. Only maintenance work occurs occasionally. In addition, in many areas they are faster and more reliable in processing tasks, and from an economic point of view they are cheaper in the long run, since for the most part there are only one-time acquisition costs, but no labor costs. <br> Artificial intelligence is already being used for optimized warehouse or demand planning, for example at FedEx or Amazon, where it is used to transport goods in the warehouse or to detect counterfeit goods. In the manufacturing sector, AI systems can also predict when machines are likely to need maintenance, eliminating the need for regular checks by humans. But it is already being used in other areas as well; for example, the Metro chain sometimes uses cameras to scan customers' shopping carts, or Johnson & Johnson has job applications pre-sorted. This not only saves time, but is also supposed to be fairer, since individual preferences of personnel managers are not the deciding factor. Even in the print media sector, press agencies such as Bloomberg and the Associated Press are having AI write shorter reports with standardized content (e.g., sports, weather and stock exchange news).<br>
There are also areas where humans and AI work hand in hand, such as in medicine. On the one hand, the doctor can be supported in a diagnosis, since an AI with a corresponding database can draw on much more knowledge. But also in medical research, new theses can be generated and verified because much more data is used and thus more complex correlations become visible.<br>
In general, there will be many areas in the future where routine work will be automated, thereby expanding the capabilities of people in their specific work context. There are still limits here, especially in activities that require forward thinking and creativity, involve hardly any repetitive work steps and take place in a constantly changing work environment. In addition, society must ask itself whether it wants to exploit all areas of the possible at all. In my view, this is particularly unsuitable for jobs that involve social interaction or even social skills, such as in nursing or geriatric care or as a teacher.<br></p>
<br><h2>What are the advantages for the individual</h2>
<p>Some readers will now raise the objection that there are also people who enjoy their job very much because it also gives them a meaning in life and they also see their job as an opportunity to interact with other individuals. Work can be identity-forming and counteract social isolation. However, in my opinion, it should not be about forcing people out of their work structures compulsively and completely. People who like to continue doing their jobs should not be deprived of the opportunity. But perhaps it is also quite dear to people if they do not have to work 40 hours or even more per week, as perhaps even half the time is enough for them. Moreover, this probably does not apply to many areas of work. Without denying anyone's enjoyment of it, I don't think most assembly line workers, cleaners, or workers in dangerous jobs (e.g., fighting fires or handling toxic chemicals) enjoy it. This list can be extended indefinitely, especially to include boring and repetitive jobs. And just these jobs are often easily compensated by AI.<br>
If in a (distant) future this scenario occurs, humans will have one thing above all: much more time. And that's where I think the greatest potential for humanity lies. You can focus on completely different areas of life, which are currently much too short for most people. People have much more time for culture, personal development, their family (caring for parents and children is also work, just defined differently in our meritocracy) or other hobbies. In short, people have the freedom to realize themselves.<br></p>
<br><h2>Political measures</h2>
<p>With all the above, it is very obvious that many jobs will be eliminated. This is also confirmed by studies, for example according to an OECD study, according to which in the near future jobs with medium qualification levels will decrease relatively compared to occupations with low or high qualification levels (â†’ polarization thesis). Another study by Frey and Osborne (2013) states that 47% of employees in the USA are exposed to a high risk of substitution, particularly in the areas of logistics, production, service, sales, construction and also in the office. However, only the theoretical automation potential was considered here, not the practically expected implementation. According to economists Casten Brzeski and Inga Burk (2015), up to 59% of jobs in Germany are threatened. In general it should also be noted that it is very difficult to forecast these areas.<br>

However, if these circumstances occur and you wants to implement the benefits mentioned in the previous section for the mass of individuals and not only for an economic elite or the owners of large companies that own the robots, this must be counteracted on a political level. There must not be a very large economic split in society. In my opinion, this social decline can only be counteracted with an unconditional basic income that guarantees social and cultural participation. Currently, this idea is still rejected by some people, which is probably mainly due to the fact that western societies are primarily focused on the performance of the individual. However, this must and will change if many jobs are no longer provided by people in the future. Another argument against this is often financial feasibility. However, there are already some (theoretical) models in this regard, such as a tax on the value added by robots or on the ownership of robots. These would then replace the currently levied wage tax or social security contributions, since employers have no expenses in this regard apart from the one-time acquisition and small maintenance costs. Rough ideas in this regard have been put forward by the EU Parliament as well as by Bill Gates and Elon Musk.<br>
Finally, it should be mentioned that training and retraining measures must also be taken. On the one hand, jobs will be created that have not existed until now, and on the other hand, humans will take on a new role in the world of work, often a more controlling or organizational one. In addition, politics must ensure the transparency of algorithms and the anonymity of data in order to guarantee equal opportunities for people (e.g., when applying for jobs).<br><br><br>
