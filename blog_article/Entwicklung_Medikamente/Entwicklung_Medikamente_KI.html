        <p>One problem in current drug research is that many as yet unsolved problems are either very complex and/or
            corresponding diseases are not widespread diseases, so they have only a small circle of sufferers and making
            research is not worthwhile from an economic point of view. Specifically, this is often due to some enzymes
            (those of the CYP450 group) that are produced in the liver and break down toxins so that they do not enter
            the bloodstream. However, many drugs block this production, which is why they cannot be used in
            humans.<br>
            Because it is often impossible to simulate the symbiosis of these enzymes with drugs in the laboratory, 90%
            of drugs are only eliminated through human trials. Some players are now hoping that AI will reduce costs by
            identifying dangerous combinations earlier and reducing the need for animal testing, which will also shorten
            the time it takes to get a drug approved.<br>
            According to a U.S. pharmaceutical company that already has its own AI department, their algorithm is 95%
            more accurate in its prediction compared to previous application methods, which means that six times fewer
            drugs have to be sorted out in later phases.<br>
            But how does an AI detect potentially toxic components or combinations earlier?<br>
            Often, it's a matter of eliminating a "target." This is the name given to a protein that is related to a
            certain disease and possibly causes it. To do this, all available information is compared with a database
            where the effects of proteins are stored. Then the AI looks for chemical compounds that could turn off the
            target. Often this is a cyclical process, because as potential candidates are found further information is
            fed into the database. This can be information on tissue samples, organ fluids or even blood samples. Also,
            the drug candidates can be tested under different conditions, e.g. with a changed oxygen content of the
            environment. With this new knowledge, the process is gone through all over again, until in the end only a
            few possibilities remain, which can then be investigated in more detail. A big problem is, just like in many
            areas of AI, that there is not (yet) enough (clinical) data to skip steps like e.g. animal
            testing.<br>
            Finally, it should be mentioned that in drug discovery, as so often with AI, the ultimate goal is to
            generate findings in areas where the interrelationships are too complex for humans. However, an AI cannot
            take over here alone, but the symbiosis of human and machine will deliver the best
            results.
