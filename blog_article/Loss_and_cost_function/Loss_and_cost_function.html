        <h1>Loss and cost function</h1><br>
        <p>Andriy Burkov writes in this book “The hundred page machine learning book” that an learning algorithm
            consists of three parts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A loss function</li>
            <li>an optimization criterion based on the loss function (a cost function for example); and</li>
            <li>an optimization routine leveraging training data to find a solution to the optimization criterion.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To understand the first two points it is necessary to understand what a loss function and cost function
            is.</p>

        <h2>Loss function</h2>
        <p>The loss function is a value which is calculated in every round of calculating a cost function. Usually you
            need multiple rounds in your learning algorithm to come closer to an actual result for which you are aiming
            for and what is usable. In every round the loss function gets calculated with updated values.</p>
        <h2>Cost function</h2>
        <p>The cost function can be seen as the average of all the results of the loss function which are calculated in
            every round in the process of a learning algorithm.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This means that the cost function describes the process of learning more in general and the loss function the
            small instances which produces the end result.
            It is possible to use different functions in the process of an cost function. One popular function is the
            mean squared error.</p>

        <p><span class="math display">\[J_D(\theta_0, \theta_1)=\frac{1}{2m} \sum\limits^{m}_{i=1} (h_\theta(x^{i})-y^{i})^{2}\]</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="math display">\(J_D(\theta_0, \theta_1)\)</span> = cost function with input of two variables for
            the linear hyptothesis</p>
        <p><span class="math display">\(m\)</span> = number of data points</p>
        <p><span class="math display">\(h_\theta\)</span> = linear hypothesis (<span class="math display">\(h_\theta(x)=\theta_0+\theta_1x\)</span>)
        </p>
        <p><span class="math display">\(x^{i}\)</span> = x of i data point</p>
        <p><span class="math display">\(y^{i}\)</span> = x of i data point</p>

        <p>The whole mathematical expression can be called cost function and every iterative step to come to the final
            result of the cost function is the result of each steps from the error function.</p>
