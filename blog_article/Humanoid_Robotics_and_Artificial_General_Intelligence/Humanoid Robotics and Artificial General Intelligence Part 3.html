        <p>Last time, in part 2, we talked about the options governments and societies have, to deal with the increased portion of the population that kind find work. If you have not read part 1 & 2, go read them first. In this third part we will look at the jobs. Which jobs get replaced? When? Why? Do they all get replaced? Let us start finding some answers to those questions.</p><br>
        <p>So far, we have talked about humanoid robotics and artificial general intelligence (AGI) as one. Now we must separate them and look at each of them specifically. All jobs can either require humanoid (or other high level) robotics or AGI or both or neither. Most jobs who require neither, are already done by robots, so we do not need to take a closer look at those. </p><br>
        <p>First, the jobs that require sophisticated robotics but no AGI. These are mostly jobs, that mandate very delicate and/or precise movement but are otherwise simple. A good example is the textile industry, which is still largely done by human labor, as handling fabric is still a challenge for robots. Any material that is stretchy, soft, or easily torn is a complex problem for robotics as precise sensors are needed to not damage the product. Another example in the car industry would be connecting two wires which are hanging freely. As their position varies, and they are moved if touched, robots have a challenge grabbing onto them. These jobs exist in very high quantities, and in some countries represent a significant part of the local industry, automating for example the textile industry could already put countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam in grave danger, as their population relies on the industry. Currently these kinds of robots are heavily researched, and Adidas already built an automated proof-of-concept factory in Germany, though it closed down again. </p><br>
        <p>This shows that even though the task might be simple for a human, robots have different kind of challenges. If you consider “chess world champion” a job, Deep Blue, a computer from IBM, would have automated that job in 1997 as it beat the reigning world champion Garry Kasparov. Even though chess world champion is a very hard to do job for a human, for a computer outperformed every human already over 24 years ago. This goes to show how different challenges and strength humans and robots have, making hard and challenging jobs as a human easy and vice versa. </p><br>
        <p>The second group of jobs are those automated by an AGI. These are jobs that are complicated but require no physical labor. It mostly includes all forms of accounting, management, hiring, engineering, design, and research, as well as jobs like lawyers, politicians, secretaries, journalists etc. They will most likely be automated not in order of complexity, but rather in order of creativity and problem-solving. The least creative jobs will be automated first, as creativity could be named “the final boss of an AGI”. Using knowledge and experience to have to solve a problem that was never encountered, is not easily trainable through machine learning. Thus, all professions with high level of creativity like artists, engineers etc. will be more challenging to replace than jobs that are easier predictable based on historical patterns.</p><br>
        <p>Lastly there are those jobs who require both, an AGI and a humanoid robot. These include jobs in nursing and retirement homes, kindergarten, police, military, cooking and all jobs that require problem solving and physical skills. </p><br>
        <p>Which group of jobs will be replaced first is hard to tell as it depends on the order of implementation of each technology. Though I think it is interesting to note, that the order of implementation is not at all correlated to how well paid the job is. Higher paid jobs are sometimes a lot easier to replace than some low paid jobs.  For example, replacing staff in a retirement home we be a big challenge, as touching humans is required, which is not just difficult but also mandates a high level of safety. On top of that a sophisticated AGI need to naturally interact with the retirees. This makes a rather low paid job, one of the hardest to automate.</p><br>
        <p>Additionally, to how difficult different professions are to automate, there will be jobs, that could be automated, but won’t be, due to a majority of people objecting it. One good example of this would be politicians. A job that, with a decent AGI, could certainly be automated, but I am convinced that a majority of society would defy the idea, to let an AGI decide what should be legal or illegal, how laws are written, and if war is waged. Other jobs may include fields like psychology, childcare, judges, sex work, and sportsmen. Though there will be robotics/AGI based options, I doubt the human work in those fields will seize to exist.</p><br>
