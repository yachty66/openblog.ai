        <h2>Part 2: The options during transition</h2>

        <p>The last post talked about the future of humanoid robotics and artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the impacts this will have on society and the future of humankind. This is Part 2, so make sure to read part 1 first, so you know what was previously discussed. In this part, we will talk about the options on how to transition to a robotic future. This will mainly go over how governments (and by that extend societies) can deal with an increased percentile of the general public that isn’t able to do work effectively.</p><br>
        <p>The first option we need to get out of the way, is banning humanoid robots and AGI from being researched, manufactured, or used. Besides being difficult to do as we already use robots on a large scale. Which one should be banned? What kind of robot is legal? Besides those hard questions, I think a ban is very unlikely to happen on a global scale, as at least some countries will see the large benefits to their economy and will research the topic. And if individual countries would ban such technologies they would have a clear competitive disadvantage on the global market, that they will either change their stance, or become so insignificant on the global scale, that countries who adopt no-AGI and no-humanoid-robotics policies wouldn’t matter in the future. Now that we have established that stopping AGI is not really an option, these are some options on how to deal with them:</p><br>
        <p>First, general basic income. Elon Musk already said it. It basically means that the government would pay every citizen a fixed amount, without any rules, or limitation. This would give everybody who isn’t able to work anymore, enough income to live, while they have no job, and are able to pursue anything all day. Everybody who would still have a job would get this income as well as their normal pay. This option would be very expensive for any government, probably needing tax increases to pay for it. One possible tax would be on the wealth generated by a robot for a company. Kind of like paying income tax for a robot, without paying a salary, as companies get more and more automated, this would keep some form of income tax for the government, on top of making human labor more competitive to robots, as the tax levels the playing field to a certain extend. This is one of the most talked about options, even though it is unclear on how governments could pay for it, and the psychological impact of having nothing useful to do all your life is unknown.</p><br>
        <p>Another option would be to give a basic income under certain conditions. The government pays everybody who wants it an income. But in order to get the funds, you would need to work as a part time job. This way the government hires, everybody who isn’t able to work in a company, and employs them just to keep them busy and get a small benefit back, for the income paid. This work would likely be tasks hardly done by robots, like spending time with residents in a retirement home. Even if robots could perfectly talk, I am convinced that most people would rather spend their time talking to a human. I will go more in depth on which jobs can be easily automated in the next part. This would cost the government less than a general basic income, as everybody who is still employed at a company would not receive any support. On top of that, the government would receive a lot of cheap workers, reducing cost on buying robots or hiring full paid staff. There could also be an option to work for NGO and non-profits as a volunteer and get the basic income from the government. For example, working at UNICEF as a volunteer to receive the income, instead of directly working for the government.</p><br>
        <p>This kind of system is already partly integrated in china, where the government would pay uneducated people to mostly do clean up works in the streets. Instead of purchasing automated equipment, like a street sweeper, they would employ larger amounts of people to do the work with brooms only to give work to people who otherwise wouldn’t find any. We could see this implemented in other countries and at larger scale as a cheaper, and more beneficiary option of basic income.</p><br>
        <p>Of course, there is always the option of not doing anything and just having a large part of the population be unemployed, but let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.</p><br>
        <p>So, there are four options. Outlaw robots, ignore the problem at hand, general basic income, and basic income for work. Let’s wait a couple of decades and we will find out which country chose which option. Or will they come up with another idea? Maybe I will do an update on this in 50 years and tell you how it went.</p><br>
