        <p>With the recent announcement from Tesla Inc. CEO, Elon Musk, on “AI Day”, that the vehicle manufacturer is working on a humanoid robot with a low intelligence general AI, I think it is overdue that this topic and its impacts are discussed. Even if the ambitious timetable of having a functioning prototype next year is off by an entire decade, I think it is fair to assume that we will see widespread use of humanoid robotics and artificial general intelligence (AGI) within our lifetimes. This opens up fundamental questions about how we, as the human race, handle this change. </p><br>
        <p>Over the last century we have automated a lot of jobs, but in general any human is currently able to do jobs, no robot can. Even with huge advancements in manufacturing, farming and other fields, every human that lost his job to a machine, was able to find one, that was not automated yet. But this trend will end once robots exist, that have an AGI that can keep up with that of parts of the population and a physical body to match the humans. To simplify it drastically, as soon as there is a cost-effective humanoid robot with an IQ of 80, no human being with an IQ of 80 or below will be able to find work in any job. This changes the society we live in, as with growing intelligence of the AGI a larger and larger part of the population will be unable to do any work that benefits society. And in the end, we will end up the same way the humans do in the 2008 Pixar movie “Wall-E”. In the movie, as there are no jobs a human can do, everyone is free at all times, following their passion. Robots took over every job and provide every amenity to all humans. This creates a world without money, income or work. Everybody can have anything at any time. And a collective of robots will create it. </p><br>
        <p>I am convinced that a future similar to the movie’s is inevitable, the only option of it not happening, is either the AGI or something else eliminates the human race beforehand. But let’s assume that does not happen, then this future of perfect communism would become reality. And yes, that is communism. Everything is shared, everybody gets their food given to them by a single entity (the AGI). No money is needed, as everyone is equal. So, what I am saying is, communism is inevitable, and an AGI will get us there. There probably will be small exceptions to this rule, like politicians (i.e., the captain in Wall-E), who still have a job and decide on laws etc. But the vast majority of society will have free time all day, and a governing body will provide anything they please.</p><br>
        <p>Now the question is: Is this a utopia or a dystopia? Yes, not needing to work might sound great for most at first sight, but not being able to usefully contribute to society makes life meaningless. If any inventions or ideas you have, were already thought of by an AGI a decade ago, there will be no great humans, like the great visionaries, inventors, and scientists of the past. All you can do is meaninglessly consume products all your life, not creating anything that last beyond your lifetime, nothing that adds to the world, or pushes humankind forward. Think of us then, like dogkind is living now. Sure, all dogs are mostly free all day. They don’t need money and get their favorite food for free. But they can not comprehend where the food came from, it just appears in their bowl, neither do they know how the house they live in is build, or the toy they love is made. This is how humankind will be one day, getting everything they could dream of, but understand nothing, and contribute to nothing. So, you tell me, is it a utopia or dystopia?</p><br>
        <p>Now this far-fetched future will need some more decades to come, if we do not get killed or kill ourselves in the meantime. But the short-term future might be even more challenging for society. What do we do if only part of humankind can not work, because the jobs are all taken by a humanoid robot? Let’s go with the earlier example of a humanoid robot with an AGI. Let’s simplify intelligence to only the IQ. If the AGI has an IQ of 80, that would make it equal to or more intelligent than roughly 10% of society. What do we do will these millions of people? Elon Musk in his announcement of the Tesla Bot already briefly talked about a universal basic income. Is that the solution? Giving everybody around 1500$ a month? Who pays for that? But if we do not do it, you cannot just let 10% of the population, which in the United States would be around 33 million people, be unemployed for life. Millions would end up living on the street. You cannot do that, can you? The percentile will keep growing until the IQ is beyond that of every human, and we get to the final stage described earlier. At what point do we have to change how we handle that? 1 %? 10%? 50%? 99%? Eventually we must change society significantly. In a future post I will talk more in depth about the options on what could be done.</p><br>
        <p>Finally, what is important to realize is, that current AI are already on that IQ scale at this point in time. But the IQ of the AGI is so low, that there are almost no humans below it, so the problem doesn’t occur yet. The IQ started at 0 with the first Computer, now it is maybe at 10? Hard to say, but we are on a clear trajectory, and the AGI will keep getting more intelligent. It is almost inevitable, the question only is: How do we handle it?</p><br>
