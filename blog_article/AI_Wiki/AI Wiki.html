<h1>AI Wiki</h1>


<p>
The following wiki should clarify topics from AI - compressed in less information. It is alphabetically sorted. This happens with the intention to build an Anki card deck. Spaced repetition is super efficient to not forget learned things <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition#">[1]</a>.
</p>
<h1>A</h1>


<p>
<strong>ANN (Artificial neural network) </strong>- Processes information through connected units. An analogy is our brain with neurons. It is an umbrella term, there are different properties
</p>
<p>
by ANNs.
</p>
<h1>B</h1>
<p>
<strong>Backpropagation</strong> - Given an artificial neural network and an error function, the method calculates the gradient of the error function with respect to the neural networks weights.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bayesian programming</strong> - Formalism and methodology  for having a technique to specify probabilistic models and solve problems when less than the necessary information is available.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Big O notation</strong> - Is an equation how the runtime changes over time with different inputs of variables.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Boolean algebra</strong> - In mathematics and mathematical logic, Boolean Algebra is the branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values true and false, usually denoted 1 and 0.
</p>


<h1>C</h1>
<p>
<strong>Clustering</strong> - Is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Computer vision </strong>- It seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.
</p>


<p>
<strong>CNN (Convolutional neural network)</strong> - Is an artificial neural network which is used for image processing and audiodatas.
</p>
<p>
<strong>CPU (central processing unit)</strong> - Is the electrical circuits who executes the commands that a computer and the programs on the computer are working.
</p>
<h1>D</h1>
<p>
<strong>Dartmouth workshop</strong> - The Dartmouth summer research project on AI was 1956 a summer workshop which counts as the founding event of AI.

</p>


<p>
<strong>Decision trees</strong> - It's a model which supports decisions in the form of a tree model and the possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs and utility.
</p>
<p>
decision node = square, chance node = circle, end node = triangle
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h1>E</h1>
<p>
<strong>Error function</strong> - Is the function which shows how far away the result of a neural network is from the actual aimed result.
</p>


<h1>F</h1>
<p>
<strong>FLOPS (Floating point operations per second)</strong> - Is the amount of floating point operations per second which a computer or everything on what  floating point operations is able to perform.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Formal language</strong> - The alphabet of a formal language consists of symbols, letters, or tokens that concatenate into strings of the language.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fuzzy logic </strong>- Fuzzy logic is a form of logic in which the truth value of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1. It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false.
</p>

<h1>G</h1>
<p>
<strong>Gradient</strong> - Holds the partial derivative of a function in one vector.
</p>


<p>
<strong>GPU (Graphics processing unit)</strong> - It's an electrical circuit who is performing tasks well iIf the computing tasks are very similar (the equations which are to calculate)  for example.

<h4><strong>SAE Classification - </strong>Different levels of the automation of cars:</h4>


<ul>

<li>Level 0: Warnings and short intervention from the car.

<li>Level 1: Driver and car sharing tasks which are necessary for driving the car but the driver is every moment ready to control every function of the driving the car (cruise control, parking assistance)

<li>Level 2: Car takes full responsibility for driving  but the driver needs to be able to intervene at every moment - “hands off”.

<li>Level 3: There is no duty of being fully focused on traffic while driving so that working on a laptop in the car is possible. Still the driver needs to be ready to intervene - “eyes off” is the motto.

<li>Level 4: Driver is not needed. Car is able in specific areas to drive from its own totally autonomous - “mind off”.

<li>Level 5: A car which drives at every condition and every geo zone - "steering wheel optional".
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Strong AI (AGI, general AI)</strong> - AI which is on an intelligence level >= an human and is able to perform a big variety of tasks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Supervised learning</strong> - Infers a function based on the generated outputs of the network from the inputs. With the network and the “integrated” function you can basically start with feeding unknown data.
</p>
<h1>T</h1>


<p>
<strong>TPU</strong> -  It's an electrical circuit which was specifically built from google to speed up machine learning applications.
</p>
<h1>U</h1>


<p>
<strong>Unsupervised learning</strong> - Learning is not with labels and a huge amount of training datas. For example clustering where you create an area in a coordinate system. Every new input in the clustering gets based on the first categorization assigned (think about clustering for a family car where the x axis is horsepower and y axis is price).
</p>
<h1>V</h1>


<h1>W</h1>


<p>
<strong>Week AI (narrow AI)</strong> - AI which is only able to perform one certain type of task, for example chess or generating text.
</p>
<h1>X</h1>


<h1>Y</h1>


<h1>Z</h1>
