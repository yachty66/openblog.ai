<h1>The difference between artificial intelligence,machine learning and deep learning</h1><br>
<p>A normal computer gets as a input questions and rules and after processing it puts out an answer. But when it comes to AI, the system gets questions and answers and create structures for it, so it can use the rules to take a prediction for new data/questions. But where are the difference between the terms artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning?<br>
AI does mean, that a engine imitate human intelligence behaviour, so it extract correlations from data and use it to do something. But there is no exact definition of AI. There exists weak AI, which is focussed on only one main theme, but also (in theory) a strong AI, which combines many areas of human life.<br>
So machine learning is a part of AI. The machine gets data and labels for the data and then it learns the structures alone on the basis of extracted features inside the data. But sometimes humans editing the structure a little bit and it´s still ML, then it´s called supervised learning.<br>
Deep learning again is a part of ML. It use a model of the nature, the human brain with its neuronal network. The neuronal network got many layers to process the data, e.g. an input, an output and many hidden layers between them. In opposite to classic ML, DL can work with unstructured/unlabeled data because it use neuronal networks and not only methods like decision trees, nearest neighbour or other „simple“ algorithm.
