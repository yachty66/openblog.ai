        <p>A normal computer gets as a input questions and rules and after processing it puts out an answer. But when it
            comes to AI, the system gets questions and answers and create structures for it, so it can use the rules to
            take a prediction for new data/questions. But where are the difference between the terms artificial
            intelligence, machine learning and deep learning?<br>
            AI does mean, that a engine imitate human intelligence behaviour, so it extract correlations from data and
            use it to do something. But there is no exact definition of AI. There exists weak AI, which is focussed on
            only one main theme, but also (in theory) a strong AI, which combines many areas of human life.<br>
            So machine learning is a part of AI. The machine gets data and labels for the data and then it learns the
            structures alone on the basis of extracted features inside the data. But sometimes humans editing the
            structure a little bit and it´s still ML, then it´s called supervised learning.<br>
            Deep learning again is a part of ML. It use a model of the nature, the human brain with its neuronal
            network. The neuronal network got many layers to process the data, e.g. an input, an output and many hidden
            layers between them. In opposite to classic ML, DL can work with unstructured/unlabeled data because it use
            neuronal networks and not only methods like decision trees, nearest neighbour or other „simple“ algorithm.
